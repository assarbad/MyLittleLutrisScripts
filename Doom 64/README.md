Play "Doom Retribution mod" on Linux!
### Technical notes:
- Doom 64 Retribution mod: Selecting Bonus Fun Maps would take you to a hub where you can choose to play a few of the secret levels in Doom 64 -- Cat and Mouse, Hardcore, and Playground. Two new maps are accessible through the Bonus Fun Maps hub: TitleMap (which was the very map used for Doom 64's opening animation) and Test Facility (which allows the player to view different rooms to test certain items and effects, such as fog, lighting, props, and enemy interaction through a monster-versus-monster arena). Another new feature was the addition of "modern" weapon animations, which are reminiscent of weapon animations from Doom and Doom II
- During installing, this script installer will not ask you for any wad file as he already use FreeDoom ones
