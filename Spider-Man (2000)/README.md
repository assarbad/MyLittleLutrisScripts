# Spider-Man 2000 - CD - dxwrapper
### Description:
Play "Spider-Man (2000)" CD edition on Linux!
### Technical notes:
- Using dxwrapper for better graphic and sound compatibility
- This game does not support ALT-TAB, which will either cause the game to crash or cause loss of keyboard/mouse functionality. To avoid this, use Gamescope
- You will need the CD only one time during install
-  Game limitations: 4:3 ratio and 30 fps maximum
- This PC port has some unresolved bug: too loud ambient audio, audio crackles and some portions of the game can only be completed at 20 fps. Read this page for more infos and workarounds: https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Spider-Man_(2001)#Issues_unresolved
- This game has insufficient controller support, you will find profiles for AntimicroX keymapper here:
