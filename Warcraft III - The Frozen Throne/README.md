# Warcraft III - The Frozen Throne - Digital
### Description:
Play "Warcraft III - The Frozen Throne" Digital edition on Linux!
### Technical notes:
- You have first to install Lutris script installer "Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos - Digital 1.27 + WS" before to install this one
- This script will download "Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne" 1.27 from official Blizzard servers in English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian or Chinese language
- Included latest 1.27b update and widescreen patch
- You will need to provide a valid key during install
- Multiplayer online is no more functionnal, but you can still play local network games (LAN). If it's a problem prefer playing "W3 - Reforged" version instead
- Running with Wine, this game could be a little unstable, it's advised to save regularly your party
- This game have issues playing cinematics. During my tests, game can play cinematics if: DXVK off, game launched in window mode (-window) with opengl renderer (-opengl). Depending on the graphics card used, MESA Zink and Gamescope could help too
